# VINZO-HostelHub
VINZO - Virtual Shared-Space using Flask and HTML/CSS/JS
VINZO is a website that provides a virtual shared-space for VIT, Chennai hostelers, where they can have access to resources which are, usually, hard to locate within the campus. It connects between the one who needs access to resources and the one who can provide with the said needs. 
Our problem statement is to design and develop a user-friendly virtual platform for hostel residents that facilitates efficient sharing and locating of essential resources, both tangible items and personal assistance, fostering a collaborative and supportive community environment.
